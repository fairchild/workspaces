## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- Terminal now runs on GhosttyKit (`libghostty`) for faster rendering and better input/focus reliability.
- Workspace terminal behavior remains the same (open per workspace, restart, and focus restore).
- Release/CI flow now builds GhosttyKit automatically before app build/tests.

### Architecture
- Replaced SwiftTerm with a thin Ghostty surface/app-manager integration layer; custom terminal theming is deferred for now.
